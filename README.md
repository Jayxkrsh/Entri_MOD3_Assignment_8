This project involves the creation of a Product database with a focus on a Customer table designed to store essential customer information such as names, contact details, and addresses. Key operations include inserting sample data for ten customers, performing various SQL queries to retrieve and analyze data, and updating customer records.

Notable queries include counting the number of persons in each country, calculating average ratings by country, and identifying countries with the same average rating as the USA. Several views were created to streamline data access, such as displaying full names and email addresses of customers and filtering for those located in the USA.

The project also addresses MySQL's safe update mode, providing guidance on enabling and disabling it to facilitate broader update operations. Overall, this work demonstrates foundational SQL skills and effective data management practices within a relational database framework.
